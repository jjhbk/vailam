Cloud-only inference fixes UX:
• fast
• streaming
• easy updates

But it also relies on trust:
• plaintext in memory
• logs & metrics
• operator access

Again, privacy depends on promises.

This is where Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) matter.

The idea is simple:

Decrypt and compute only inside a hardware-isolated boundary.

Not “we won’t look.”
But “we physically can’t.”

6/
In a TEE-backed private LLM:

• prompts are encrypted in the browser
• decryption happens only inside the enclave
• inference runs in isolated memory
• outputs are encrypted before leaving
• no plaintext hits disk or logs

7/
This changes the trust model completely.

You no longer trust:
• operators
• access controls
• retention policies

You trust:
• hardware isolation
• cryptography
• explicit boundaries

Why TEEs beat local-only or cloud-only approaches:

Local inference → privacy, poor usability
Cloud-only inference → usability, weak privacy

TEE-backed inference gives:
✅ real-time UX
✅ streaming
✅ model updates
✅ strong confidentiality

9/
This isn’t about perfect crypto or theory.

It’s about deployable privacy:
• works today
• scales to real users
• doesn’t require everyone to own a GPU

That balance is what actually matters.

This thinking led me to build Vailam — an experiment in confidential AI where:
• chats are end-to-end encrypted
• servers are stateless
• memory lives with the user
• privacy is enforced by architecture, not policy

11/
As AI moves into healthcare, law, finance, and personal decision-making,
“trust us” architectures won’t be enough.

Confidential compute isn’t optional — it’s becoming foundational.

12/
If you’re working on:
• private LLMs
• confidential compute
• AI infrastructure
• secure systems

I’d love to connect and exchange notes.
(And yes — this really did start as a weekend project.)
